# Breeds_core_ml

This is a custom made breed classifier convolutional neural network (CNN) with an error_rate of 0.055480 (accuracy 99.95%)

This model classifies from 37 breeds.

The model was customly made using the Pytorch together with Fast.ai fast.ai libraries.

Using resnet 50 architecture I managed to achieve error_rate of 0.055480. 

The notebook used to create the model will be released soon.
